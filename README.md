# STM32F4-StartupCode-LinkerScript

This project aims to implement startup code and a linker script specifically for the STM32F446RE Nucleo board.

## Getting Started

### Install ARM GCC Toolchain
   To install the ARM GCC toolchain, use the following command:
   ```bash
   brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
   ```


### Build the Project
  After installing the toolchain, you can compile and link the project by running:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```

### Debugging and Flashing the Code

1. **Install OpenOCD:**:
   Download OpenOCD using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install open-ocd
   ```
2. **Connect the Nucleo Board:**:
    Connect the STM32

3. **Start OpenOCD Server:**
   Start the OpenOCD server with the correct configuration for the Nucleo board:
   ```bash
   openocd -f st_nucleo_f4.cfg
   ```
   
4. **Launch GDB Client:**:
   Start the GDB client to interact with the OpenOCD server:
   ```bash
   arm-none-eabi-gdb
   ```
5. **Connect to OpenOCD Server:**:
    Connect GDB to the OpenOCD server with:
   ```bash
   target remote localhost:3333
   ```

6. **Flash the Code:**
   Use the following commands to flash the code:
   ```bash
   monitor reset init
   monitor flash write_image erase final.elf
   ```
7. **Run the Code:**
   After flashing, run the code with:
   ```bash
   monitor reset halt
   monitor resume
  ```
